Approaches that I used

A1-Question was a standard two pointer approach, initialise a left and a right pointer then find the min heights of all the left and right pointers then multiply that with the width i.e the difference between l and r pointers, 

A2-Revised Kadanes algo with this q- simple maxsum, currsum implementation using Math.max

A3-Spent an hour on this but couldn't solve it, tweaked around and saw the solution eventually,
essentially distribute one  candy each to everyone then and then do a left pass and greedily increment candies, similarily do a right pass from r to l and apply the same constraints to increase candies

A5-Essentially find the min distance of each house to a heater, then essentially return the max of that, pretty simple logic 
lil bit challenging implementation , can be done using binary search too.
