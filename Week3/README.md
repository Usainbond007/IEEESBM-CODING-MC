Approaches I used

A5-Straightforward bfs implementation if was the last el in the level point to null
A3-Just make a monotonic increasing stack and return its size -logic since each chunk needs to be sorted and then concat-use stack as it can backtrack and keep track of prev elements in order.
E4- simple monotonic stack implementation where you only push elements greater than 0 and if its not you check if its smaller and then pop and create another edge case where both the values are equal and pop.
